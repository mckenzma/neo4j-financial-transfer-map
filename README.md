# Neo4j Financial Transfer Map

This is a simple example showing how Neo4j can be used to build a personal financial transfer map. I began by building a tranfer map in a spreadsheet. I quickly discovered that it lacked the flexibility to match the constraints I was working with. Upon discovering Neo4j and cypher I proceeded to construct the finanical transfer map I had created.

Creating a financial transfer map allowed me to budget monthly bills, savings, investments, and loan payments.

If you are interested in learning cypher and Neo4j, please feel free to start here and tinker. I will continue to add additional queries and concepts as I continue to build it out.
